This software is a prototype.

Currently, Julia language must already be installed and on the user's path for this software to function properly.

The cli is currently not fully functional / tested on Windows; it works well on Linux / WSL though (and presumably MacOS, too).


Otherwise, the cli has some useful functionality already - feel free to give it a try and give feedback on the API!
